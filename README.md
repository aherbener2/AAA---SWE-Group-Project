Project Summary:

This is a web-based application to assist Computer Science students attending Georgia State University to better coordinate when to visit the Computer Science Tutoring Center based on which tutors are available. Students often find that a tutor is not always available to help them in the specific course they are seeking help. This application will allow tutors to sign up, login, and update their schedule with the courses they are eligible to tutor. Students will then be able to visit the site and see when they want to visit the tutoring center.

This project is built with a MySQL database connecting to a Spring Boot Application written in Java and an Angular application for the front-end.
